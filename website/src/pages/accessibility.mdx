Tooltips have some basic attributes to help with accessibility.

It's recommended that tooltips are applied only to natively focusable elements
like `<button>`. Most screenreader software will not announce the tooltip on an
element like `<div>`.

### Trigger

The default trigger for tooltips is `"mouseenter focus"`. This means both a
hover and focus via keyboard navigation will trigger a tooltip.

### ARIA attributes

By default, the reference element receives an `aria-describedby` attribute
(configurable) once the tooltip is fully shown.

```html
<button aria-describedby="tippy-1">Text</button>
<div id="tippy-1" role="tooltip" class="tippy-popper">
  <!-- inner elements -->
</div>
```

This allows screenreader software to announce the tooltip content describing the
reference element. No work is required by you to achieve this functionality.

### Popovers and interactivity

By default, interactive tippys will be auto-focused once they are fully shown to
allow the user to interact with elements inside it. However, some additional
work will be needed in certain cases.

It's recommended that an interactive tippy with a `focus` trigger is appended
directly after the reference element in the DOM tree using the `appendTo` option
and have `autoFocus` disabled. If triggered by a `click`, the default options
suffice.

For UI elements like dropdowns, you should apply these attributes to the
reference:

- `aria-haspopup="true"`
- `aria-expanded="false"`

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<!-- The element should have its own wrapper. -->
<div>
  <button aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Text</button>
</div>
```

We will need to dynamically change the `aria-expanded` attribute based on the
state of the tooltip:

```js
tippy('button', {
  autoFocus: false,
  appendTo: ref => ref.parentNode,
  onMount({ reference }) {
    reference.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'true')
  },
  onHide({ reference }) {
    reference.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'false')
  },
})
```

<Demo>
  <Button>Click me then press Tab</Button>
  <Dropdown />
</Demo>

Elements within the tippy can be tabbed to since they are directly after the
reference element. The tooltip automatically hides once no elements inside it
are in focus.

If for some reason you don't want the tooltip to hide once blurred, you can
define the following option:

```js
tippy('button', {
  shouldPopperHideOnBlur(focusOutEvent) {
    // You can read the `focusout` event object
    // to determine which boolean should be returned.
    return false
  },
})
```
