It's recommended that tooltips are applied only to natively focusable elements
like `<button>`. Most screenreader software will not announce the tooltip on an
element like `<div>`.

Non-interactive tooltips are accessible by default. The default trigger for
tooltips is `"mouseenter focus"`. This means both a hover and focus via keyboard
navigation will trigger a tooltip.

In addition, the reference element receives an `aria-describedby` attribute
(configurable) once the tooltip is fully shown:

```html
<button aria-describedby="tippy-1">Text</button>
<div id="tippy-1" role="tooltip" class="tippy-popper">
  <!-- inner elements -->
</div>
```

This allows screenreader software to announce the tooltip content describing the
reference element. No work is required by you to achieve this functionality.

### Interactivity

Although non-interactive tooltips are accessible by default, making interactive
tooltips accessible requires a bit of work by you.

For UI elements like dropdowns, you should apply these attributes to the
reference element:

- `aria-haspopup="true"`
- `aria-expanded="false"`

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```html
<!-- The element should have its own wrapper. -->
<div>
  <button aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">Text</button>
</div>
```

The following options are recommended:

```js
tippy('button', {
  interactive: true,
  // `focus` is not suitable for buttons with dropdowns
  trigger: 'click',
  // Don't announce the tooltip's contents when expanded
  aria: null,
  // Important: the tooltip should be DIRECTLY after the reference element
  // in the DOM source order, which is why it has its own wrapper element
  appendTo: 'parent',
  // Let the user know the popup has been expanded
  onMount({ reference }) {
    reference.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'true')
  },
  onHide({ reference }) {
    reference.setAttribute('aria-expanded', 'false')
  },
})
```

<Demo>
  <Button>Click me then press Tab</Button>
  <Dropdown text="Press enter to click" />
</Demo>

Using this technique, elements within the tippy can be tabbed to since they are
directly after the reference element.

It's also possible to change the `role` of the tippy to something other than
`"tooltip"`:

```js
tippy('button', {
  role: 'menu',
})
```

### Delays and keyboard navigation

When using keyboard navigation, it's probably best if there are no delays so
that screenreaders can announce the tippy content as soon as possible if focus
is currently on the reference element.

<Demo>
  <Tippy delay={500} duration={[300, 200]}>
    <Button>Normal delay</Button>
  </Tippy>
  <Tippy
    delay={500}
    duration={[300, 200]}
    onTrigger={(instance, event) => {
      if (event.type === 'focus') {
        instance.set({ delay: 0, duration: [200, 150] })
      }
    }}
    onHide={instance => {
      instance.set({ delay: 500, duration: [300, 200] })
    }}
  >
    <Button>No keyboard delay</Button>
  </Tippy>
</Demo>

```js
const delay = 500
const duration = [300, 200]

tippy('button', {
  delay,
  duration,
  onTrigger(instance, event) {
    if (event.type === 'focus') {
      // If the tippy was triggered by a `focus` event (e.g keyboard navigation)
      // then set `delay: 0` and reduce the duration a bit.
      instance.set({ delay: 0, duration: [200, 150] })
    }
  },
  onHide(instance) {
    // Reset
    instance.set({ delay, duration })
  },
})
```
