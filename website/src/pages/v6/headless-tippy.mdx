"Headless Tippy" refers to Tippy without any of the default element rendering or
CSS. This allows you to create your own element from scratch and use Tippy for
its logic only.

This means all props marked with the R symbol in [All Props](../all-props/) no
longer "work" by default, since it's your responsibility to create these
features.

### Usage

```js
import tippy from 'tippy.js/dist/tippy-headless.esm.js';

tippy(targets, {
  content: 'Hello!',
  render(props) {
    const popper = document.createElement('div');
    popper.className = 'my-custom-class';
    popper.textContent = props.content;

    function update(prevProps, nextProps) {
      if (prevProps.content !== nextProps.content) {
        popper.textContent = nextProps.content;
      }
    }

    // Return an object with two properties: `popper` (the root popper element),
    // and an `update` function whenever .setProps() or .setContent() is called
    return {
      popper,
      update
    };
  }
});
```

> **Mutations**
>
> Two mutations are done to your popper element by Tippy:
>
> - `id` attribute is set on it
> - `data-tippy-root` attribute is set on it
>
> This has no effect on libraries/frameworks like React or Vue, provided you
> don't specify these attributes.
