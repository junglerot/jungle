"Headless Tippy" refers to Tippy without any of the default element rendering or
CSS. This allows you to create your own element from scratch and use Tippy for
its logic only.

This means all props marked with the R symbol in [All Props](../all-props/) no
longer "work" by default, since it's your responsibility to create these
features.

### Usage

> **Note**
>
> Headless Tippy will not unmount the tippy from the DOM upon hide. It's up to
> you to call `instance.unmount()`, which allows you to create hide animations.

This demonstrates the basic usage â€” supply a `render` function and call
`instance.unmount()` in the `onHide` lifecycle:

```js
import tippy from 'tippy.js/headless';

tippy(targets, {
  content: 'Hello!',
  // Required:
  // This is where you'll perform your CSS or JavaScript animations and call
  // the .unmount() method once the animation finishes
  onHide(instance) {
    instance.unmount();
  },
  render(instance) {
    // The recommended structure is to use the popper as an outer wrapper
    // element, with an inner `box` element
    const popper = document.createElement('div');
    const box = document.createElement('div');

    popper.appendChild(box);

    box.className = 'my-custom-class';
    box.textContent = instance.props.content;

    function onUpdate(prevProps, nextProps) {
      // DOM diffing
      if (prevProps.content !== nextProps.content) {
        box.textContent = nextProps.content;
      }
    }

    // Return an object with two properties:
    // - `popper` (the root popper element)
    // - `onUpdate` callback whenever .setProps() or .setContent() is called
    return {
      popper,
      onUpdate // optional
    };
  }
});
```

### Mutations

Tippy performs a few mutations to your popper element, so you should avoid
specifying these:

#### Attributes

- `id` attribute is set (for accessibility)
- `data-tippy-root` attribute is set (to allow for nesting)

#### Properties

- `_tippy` property is set on it (to allow for nesting)

#### Styles

- `visibility` is changed on show or hide
- `pointerEvents` is changed based on the `interactive` prop
- `transition` is changed based on the `moveTransition` prop

### Imports

When using Headless Tippy, all imports (e.g. `followCursor`) should also be
specified from this import, otherwise you will end up with duplicate code bloat.

```js
import tippy, {followCursor} from 'tippy.js/headless';
```
